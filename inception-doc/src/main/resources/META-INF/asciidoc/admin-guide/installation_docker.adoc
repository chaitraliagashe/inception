= Running via Docker

== Quick start

If you have Docker installed, you can run {product-name} using

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker run -it --name inception -p8080:8080 inceptionproject/inception:{revnumber}
----

The command downloads {product-name} from Dockerhub and starts it on port 8080. If this port is not
available on your machine, you should provide another port to the `-p` parameter. 

The logs will be printed to the console. To stop the container, press `CTRL-C`.

To run the {product-name} docker in the background use 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker run -d --name inception -p8080:8080 inceptionproject/inception:{revnumber}
----

Logs are accessible by typing 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker logs inception
----

NOTE: Use `docker run` only the first time that you run {product-name}. If you try it a second time, Docker
      will complain about the name `inception` already being in use. If you follow Docker`s suggestion
      to delete the container, you will loose all your {product-name} data. Further below, we explain how
      you can store your data outside the container in a folder on your host.
      
When you want to run {product-name} again later, use the command

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker start -ai inception
----

or for the background mode 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker start inception
----

== Storing data on the host

If you follow the quick start instructions above, {product-name} will store all its data inside the docker
container. This is normally not what you want because as soon as you delete the container, all data
is gone. That means for example that you cannot easily upgrade to a new version of the {product-name}
docker image when one is released.

To store your data on your host computer, first create a folder where you want to store your data.
For example, if you are on Linux, you could create a folder `/srv/inception`:

----
$ mkdir /srv/inception
----

When you run {product-name} via Docker, you then mount this folder into the container:

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker run -it --name inception -v /srv/inception:/export -p8080:8080 inception/inception:{revnumber}
----

== Settings file

The dockerized {product-name} expects the `settings.properties` file in the `/export` folder. Instead of
injecting a custom `settings.properties` file into the container, it is strongly recommender to
use the instructions above (Storing data on the host) to mount a folder from the host system to 
`/export` then to place the into the mounted folder `settings.properties`. Thus, if you follow
the instructions above, the settings file would go to `/srv/webanno/settings.properties` on the host
system.

== Connecting to a MySQL database

By default, {product-name} uses an embedded SQL database to store its metadata (not the texts,
annotations and knowledge bases, these are stored in files on disk). For production use, it is highly
recommended to use a separate MySQL database instead of the embedded SQL database.

You can do so by providing a second Docker for MySQL (see for example link:https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/[this one]).
We provide a docker-compose example file, which combines the two containers. In order to use this, download link:admin-guide/scripts/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose.yml] and place it into any folder, change to that folder, and issue the commands

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
export INCEPTION_HOME=/srv/inception
export INCEPTION_PORT=8080
docker-compose -p inception up -d
----

This will start two docker containers: `inception_mysqlserver_1`, and `inception_webserver_1`. You can check the logs of each by running 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker logs inception_mysqlserver_1
docker logs inception_webserver_1
----

The actual name of these containers might vary. A list of running containers can be retrieved by

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker ps
----

Two directories in your {product-name} home folder will be created: `mysql-data` and `webserver-data`. No data is stored in the containers themselves, you are safe to delete them with 

[source,text,subs="+attributes"]
----
docker-compose -p inception down
----

You can also just stop or pause them, please see the link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose reference] for details.

NOTE: The settings within the docker-compose.yml file are just examples. Adjust the database URL, username, and password accordingly.
