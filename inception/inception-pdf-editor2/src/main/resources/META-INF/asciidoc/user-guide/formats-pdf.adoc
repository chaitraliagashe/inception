[[sect_formats_pdf]]
= PDF Format

You can import PDF files into {product-name} for annotation.
PDF files can be viewed and annotated in their original form, or you can switch e.g. to the **brat editor** or **HTML editor** to annotate the text extracted from the PDF.

When importing PDF files, {product-name} will automatically detect token and sentence boundaries. Currently, it is not possible to override these boundaries externally.

[NOTE]
====
When importing a PDF file, you may get a message that the file cannot be imported because it is _empty_.
You may be confused because you can see contents in the PDF if you open the file in your PDF viewer of choice.
It may be that your PDF contains only an image of the text, but not actual text data.
For {product-name} to be able to work with a PDF, it must be _searchable_â€”i.e., the text must not only be included as an image but as actual Unicode character information.
You may try using an OCR tool to process your PDF into a searchable PDF before importing it.
====

[NOTE]
====
PDF files support a feature called **"annotations"** (such as notes, comments, or highlights) that you may create in tools like Acrobat Reader. These are embedded in the PDF file itself. You may be able to see those in the annotation editor, but do not confuse them with {product-name} annotations. There is currently no way for {product-name} to interact with these **"annotations."**
====

The following table summarizes the supported PDF formats for import and export:

[cols="2,1,1,3"]
|====
| Format | Import | Export | Supported layers

| PDF (`pdf2`)
| yes
| yes
| None on import, span layers as PDF annotations on export.

| ðŸ§ª PDF (with embedded JSON CAS) (`pdf2JsonCas`)
| no
| yes
| Span layers as PDF annotations on export, full annotations in embedded CAS.

| ðŸ§ª PDF (with embedded XMI CAS) (`pdf2XmiCas`)
| no
| yes
| Span layers as PDF annotations on export, full annotations in embedded CAS.
|====

[CAUTION]
====
PDF export formats with embedded CAS are experimental.
To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `format.pdf-json-cas.enabled=true` and/or `format.pdf-xmi-cas.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings, Admin Guide>>).

.PDF import settings
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example

| `format.pdf.sort-by-position`
| Whether to sort the text as it appears on screen or leave it as it appears in the PDF file. 
  This may help with PDFs generated by writers that output text sorted by style.
  However, it may cause problems with other types of PDFs, e.g., those that contain watermark text in the background. 
| `false` 
| `true`

| `format.pdf.suppress-duplicate-overlapping-text`
| Whether to suppress duplicate overlapping text. By default, the text stripper will attempt to remove overlapping text.
  Setting this to false will extract all text, which may result in duplicate sections but better performance.
| `true` 
| `false`

| `format.pdf.should-separate-by-beads`
| Whether the text stripper should group the text output by a list of beads.
| `false`
| `true`

| `format.pdf.add-more-formatting`
| Whether additional text formatting will be added.
| `false`
| `true`

| `format.pdf.indent-threshold`
| The multiple of whitespace character widths for the current text which the current line start can be indented from the previous line start beyond which the current line start is considered to be a paragraph start.
| `2.0`
| `1.5`

| `format.pdf.drop-threshold`
| The minimum whitespace, as a multiple of the max height of the current characters, beyond which the current line start is considered to be a paragraph start.
| `2.5`
| `3.0`

| `format.pdf.average-char-tolerance`
| The character width-based tolerance value that is used to estimate where spaces in text should be added.
  Larger values reduce the number of spaces added.
| `0.3`
| `0.5`

| `format.pdf.spacing-tolerance`
| The space width-based tolerance value that is used to estimate where spaces in text should be added.
  Larger values reduce the number of spaces added.
| `0.5`
| `0.7`

| `format.pdf.generate-html-structure`
| Try extracting a basic HTML structure (mainly paragraphs) to improve the rendering of the document in HTML-based editors.
| `false`
| `true`
