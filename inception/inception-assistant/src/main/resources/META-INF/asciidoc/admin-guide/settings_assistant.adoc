.Settings related to the assistant
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example

| `assistant.enabled`
| Whether to enable the assistant
| `false`
| `true`

| `assistant.force-rebuild-user-manual-index`
| Whether to re-build the user manual index at the start of the application.
| `false`
| `true`

| `assistant.url`
| URL of the Ollama service
| `http://localhost:11434`
| _some other URL_

| `assistant.chat.model`
| The model to use to drive the chat functionality of the assistant
| `llama3.2`
| `mistral-nemo`

| `assistant.chat.context-length`
| The context length supported by the model. 
This controls how much chat history will be preserved.
| `4096`
| `16000`

| `assistant.chat.top-p`
| Controls the diversity of output by sampling tokens from the smallest set whose probabilities sum to the threshold. 
Tune the balance between diversity (high, 0.9) and coherence (low, 0.3-0.5).
| `0.3`
| `0.90`

| `assistant.chat.top-k`
| Controls the number of top-ranked tokens considered for sampling during text generation. 
Tune the balance between diversity (high >= 50) and coherence (low e.g. 5).
| `25`
| `50`

| `assistant.chat.repeat-penalty`
| Discourages the model from repeating the same words or phrases by reducing the probability of tokens already generated, promoting more varied and coherent outputs. 
Tune the balance between less repetition (high >= 1.5) and more repetition (low, 1.0).
| `1.1`
| `1.5`

| `assistant.chat.temperature`
| Temperature controls the randomness of the model's output by adjusting the probability distribution of the next word. 
Tune the balance between more randomness (high >= 1.0) and less randomness (low, 0.5).
| `0.1`
| `0.8`

| `assistant.embedding.model`
| The model to use to drive the search functionality of the assistant
| `granite-embedding`
| `snowflake-arctic-embed`

| `assistant.document-index.idle-eviction-delay`
| How often the index pool is checked for idle indexes.
| `5m`
| `5s`

| `assistant.document-index.min-idle-time`
| How long an index may remain in the pool before being considered for eviction.
| `5m`
| `5s`

| `assistant.document-index.borrow-wait-timeout`
| How long to wait for access to an index before timing out.
| `3m`
| `15s`
