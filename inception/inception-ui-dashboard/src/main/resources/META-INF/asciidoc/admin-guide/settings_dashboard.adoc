NOTE: To specify multiple values of the `ui.dashboard.accessible-by-roles` in a `settings.properties`
      file, multiple lines need to be added like `ui.dashboard.accessible-by-roles[0]=ANNOTATOR`, 
      `ui.dashboard.accessible-by-roles[1]=CURATOR`, etc.

NOTE: Project managers can always access the project dashboard, even if they are not included in the
      `ui.dashboard.accessible-by-roles` setting.
