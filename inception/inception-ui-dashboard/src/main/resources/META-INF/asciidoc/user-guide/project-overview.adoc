[[sect_projects_list]]
= Project overview

After logging in to {product-name}, the first thing you see is the project overview.
Here, you can see all the projects to which you have access.
For every project, the roles you have are shown.

.Filtering and sorting projects
By default, all projects you have access to are visible.
Using the filter toggle buttons (top left), you can select which projects are listed depending on the xref:Project_roles[role] that you have in them.
You can also sort the project list using the sort menu, choosing between:

- *Name*: Sorts projects alphabetically by their name.
- *Created (oldest first)*: Shows the oldest projects first.
- *Created (newest first)*: Shows the most recently created projects first.
- *Recently updated*: Shows the projects that were updated most recently at the top.

Additionally, you can use the query field to filter projects by name. If you enter a search term containing `::`, the text before the `::` is used to filter by project name, and the text after is used to filter by project description. If only a single project remains after filtering, pressing Enter in the query field will directly open that project.

.Creating and importing projects
Users with the role *project creator* can conveniently *create new projects* or *import project archives* on this page.

.Leaving a project
Users without a *manager* role can leave a project by clicking on the *Leave Project* button accessible via the dots menu on the right end of a project line.

.Advanced import options for administrators
When uploading projects via this page, user roles for the project are typically not fully imported! 
If the importing user has the role *project creator*, then the *manager* role is added for the importing user.
Otherwise, only the roles of the importing user are retained.
For users with the *admin* role, additional options to *create missing users* and *import all permissions* are available.

If the current instance has users with the same name as those who originally worked on the
import project, the manager can add these users to the project and they can access their annotations.
Otherwise, only the imported source documents are accessible. 

Users with the role *admin* who wish to import projects with all permissions and optionally 
create missing users have to do this through the <<sect_projects>> which can be accessed through
the *Administration* link in the menu bar.
