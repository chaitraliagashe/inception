= Bulk Processing

Bulk processing allows to perform operations across multiple documents in a single step.

On this page, you can see a list of the bulk processing tasks that are available.
When you click on a task, a dialog opens that allows you to configure the task and start it.
In the sidebar on the right, you can see the status of the currently running tasks and completed tasks.

== Extract Tag Set

This tasks collects the labels from a specific string feature across all documents in the project and creates a tag set from them.
You can either add the tags to an existing tag set or create a new one.

== ðŸ§ª Bulk Curation

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `bulk-processing.process.auto-curation.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings, Admin Guide>>).
This process is still experimental and may not work as expected in all cases. 
*It may override already curated documents.*
It is strongly recommended to test this process on a copy of your project first.
====


The curation of a document starts with a curator opens the document on the curation page.
At that point, an initial merge of the annotations done by the annotators is performed and the curation document is created.
That means, a human curator would have to go over all the documents once to create the curation document, even if the annotators may all agree on the annotations.
Using the bulk curation task, you can create the curation documents for all documents in a project in one step.
If the annotators agree on the annotations, the process will already mark the documents as curated,leaving only those documents that have conflicting annotations for the curator to resolve.

== ðŸ§ª Apply Recommender

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `bulk-processing.process.apply-recommender.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings, Admin Guide>>).
====

Recommenders are normally an interactive feature.
The recommender generates annotation suggestions as the user is working on a document.
However, in some cases, it may be useful to apply the recommender to all documents in a project.
This task allows you to do that.
